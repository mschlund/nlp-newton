nlp-newton
==========

Supplementary material to our [submission for some conference].

Includes the python-script we used to annotate trees with dimension and to call the Stanford parser.
We made some (very minor) changes to the parser (the code is available on request of course---we are also trying to extract a patch for it).

You need nltk, the TÃ¼Ba-D/Z treebank and the stanford-parser.
